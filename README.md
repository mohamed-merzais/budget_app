# budget_app

This is a personal project.
It's a budgetting and spending tracker application created for self-employed people to track their earnings and spendings daily.
This project based on my personal history of being self employed and needing a good application to keep track of my finances.

Features
- weekly calendar view as a chart showing that weeks spending/earnings
- users able to add a new transaction either as a spending or earnings
- potential graph to show previous history
- budgetting section to try and reach a certain savings
